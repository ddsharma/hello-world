# hello-world
pretty much my first github learning project
I have heard a lot about github. Have tried to do Udacity course but kind of felt lost.
Have asked people to explain it to me. Noot much success.
What stumbled me was not having a big picture view.
This Hello World guide, so far, is working fine.
